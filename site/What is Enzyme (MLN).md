# What is Enzyme (MLN)?

Enzyme Finance is a decentralized asset management protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally launched as Melon Protocol, it rebranded to focus on empowering both retail and institutional investors through DeFi. This article explores how Enzyme revolutionizes asset management, its unique features, and its role in the evolving crypto ecosystem.

## Key Features of Enzyme

Enzyme offers a robust framework for creating and managing investment strategies, combining DeFi tools with traditional financial principles. Here are its standout features:

- **Custom Investment Strategies**: Users can design and automate vaults based on personalized strategies, enabling tailored portfolio management.
- **Open-Source Framework**: The protocolâ€™s code is publicly accessible, fostering transparency and community contributions, with bug bounty rewards up to $400,000.
- **Diverse User Base**: Serves asset managers, treasurers, retail investors, and DAOs, democratizing access to advanced tools.
- **Community-Driven Governance**: MLN token holders influence protocol upgrades via the Enzyme Council, a decentralized governance body.
- **Third-Party Audits**: Regular security audits by firms like PwC ensure smart contract integrity.
- **DeFi Integrations**: Partnerships with Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and others enhance yield generation and liquidity options.

## How Enzyme Works

Enzyme operates through two architectural layers:

1. **Fund Layer**: Vaults (funds) are created and managed here. Users interact directly with Ethereum-based smart contracts to deploy strategies.
2. **Infrastructure Layer**: Managed by the Enzyme Council, this layer handles asset pricing, MLN-to-ETH conversions for gas fees, and protocol governance.

Vault types include:
- **Public Vaults**: Open to all investors.
- **Private Vaults**: Require manager approval for deposits.
- **Hybrid Vaults**: Combine public and private access with customizable rules.

## Use Cases and Tokenomics

### MLN Token Utility

The native MLN token serves three primary functions:
1. **Fee Discounts**: Paying network fees with MLN offers a 50% discount, incentivizing token adoption.
2. **Protocol Development**: Up to 300,600 MLN tokens are minted annually to fund ecosystem growth.
3. **Governance Participation**: MLN holders vote on proposals, with a 20% annual inflation rate to reward participation.

### Token Supply Dynamics

Enzyme employs a **mint-and-burn mechanism** to balance supply:
- **Minting**: New tokens are issued to finance development, but the protocol aims for long-term deflationary pressure as demand grows.
- **Burning**: The Enzyme Council approves token burns to reduce supply. Over 382,125 MLN tokens (18% of circulating supply) have been burned since 2019.

As of August 2022, 2,038,528 MLN tokens were in circulation, with no maximum supply cap.

## Historical Background

Founded in 2016 by Mona El Isa (ex-Goldman Sachs VP) and Rito Trinkler, Enzyme raised $2.9 million in an ICO within 10 minutes during its 2017 development phase. The mainnet launched in February 2019, transitioning from centralized governance to a DAO model. Key updates include:
- **Enzyme V2 (2021)**: Introduced a redesigned smart contract architecture.
- **Sulu Upgrade (2022)**: Enhanced vault customization and risk management tools.

## Competitive Landscape

While Unido Enterprise Platform targets enterprises using Polkadot, Enzymeâ€™s focus on retail investors gives it broader appeal. Despite slower revenue from retail currently, Enzymeâ€™s larger user base (85+ million AUM) and 1148 vaults position it for growth as DeFi adoption expands.

## Strategic Partnerships

Enzyme collaborates with leading DeFi protocols:
- **Lending Platforms**: Aave, Compound
- **DEXs**: Uniswap, Curve Finance
- **Yield Optimizers**: Convex Finance, Yearn
- **Cross-Chain Tools**: Polygon (for low-cost vault creation)
