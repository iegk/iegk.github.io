# Bitcoin Integration into US Mortgage System Sparks Market Surge  

The potential integration of Bitcoin into the United States mortgage system has ignited significant market excitement. On June 25, 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Bill Pulte announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac‚Äîthe twin pillars of the U.S. mortgage market‚Äîwould explore incorporating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into their loan evaluation frameworks. This revelation triggered a 2.2% surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, pushing it to $107,000 and elevating its market dominance to 66%.  

Bill Pulte, grandson of Pulte Homes founder William J. Pulte, brings a unique perspective to his role. Appointed in March 2025 during Donald Trump‚Äôs second term, Pulte has openly advocated for cryptocurrencies since 2019, leveraging his social media influence to promote digital asset adoption. Financial disclosures reveal he holds $500,000‚Äì$1 million in Bitcoin and Solana, owns shares in U.S.-based Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, and has invested in speculative stocks like GameStop.  

This article delves into the implications of FHFA‚Äôs move, the mechanics of mortgage-backed securities, and how Bitcoin‚Äôs inclusion could reshape financial ecosystems globally.

## Understanding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  

Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that dominate the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Together, they underpin approximately 70% of all U.S. mortgages by purchasing loans from lenders and securitizing them into marketable bonds.  

Their role is analogous to a hybrid system combining elements of China‚Äôs **Housing Provident Fund**, **state-owned banks**, and **mortgage-backed securities platforms**, but with a more market-driven approach. By acting as perpetual buyers, they ensure liquidity in the housing market, enabling banks to issue new loans without retaining long-term risk.  

FHFA, established in 2008 to oversee these GSEs post-financial crisis, now faces a pivotal decision: whether to classify cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets in mortgage underwriting.

## How Could Crypto Assets Be Evaluated?  

Currently, borrowers seeking to use cryptocurrency in mortgage applications must convert digital assets to fiat currency and deposit the funds into a U.S. bank account. These funds must ‚Äúseason‚Äù for 60 days to meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac‚Äôs reserve requirements. However, FHFA‚Äôs review could overhaul these rules:  

1. **Valuation Volatility**: Cryptocurrencies‚Äô price fluctuations pose risks. Lenders might apply a ‚Äúhaircut‚Äù to Bitcoin‚Äôs market value (e.g., valuing $100,000 in Bitcoin at $80,000) to account for potential drops.  
2. **Holding Periods**: Long-term holdings with documented custody history could carry more weight than short-term or frequently traded assets.  
3. **Stablecoin Consideration**: USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT) might bypass volatility concerns due to their dollar pegs, though regulatory scrutiny of their reserve transparency remains a hurdle.

## Private Sector Pioneers the Trend  

While FHFA‚Äôs deliberations are in early stages, private lenders have already launched crypto-backed mortgage products:  

| Company          | Product Overview                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Milo Credit**  | Offers up to 100% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages secured by Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. $65M+ issued since 2022. |
| **Figure Technologies** | Led by ex-SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, provides loans up to $20M using crypto as collateral. |
| **Ledn**         | "Bitcoin Savings Account" allows 50% LTV dollar loans against Bitcoin holdings.    |

However, these loans operate outside the federal system, limiting liquidity and forcing lenders to retain risk or partner with alternative investors. High volatility also necessitates **overcollateralization**‚Äîborrowers must pledge assets exceeding the loan value‚Äîto mitigate price swings.

## Why This Matters for Bitcoin Adoption  

FHFA‚Äôs exploration marks a paradigm shift: from treating Bitcoin as a speculative asset to recognizing it as a viable financial instrument. If integrated, it could:  
- **Expand Financial Access**: Enable crypto holders to leverage digital wealth without liquidating positions.  
- **Stabilize Markets**: Institutional adoption may reduce volatility through structured demand.  
- **Signal Regulatory Momentum**: Encourage global regulators to formalize crypto-asset frameworks.  

Yet challenges remain. Regulatory clarity on stablecoin reserves, taxation protocols, and cross-border implications must be resolved before widespread adoption.
