## Why Blockchain Confirmation Matters  

Blockchain confirmations represent the number of blocks added to the chain after a transaction is recorded. For USDT, which operates on multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Tron), understanding confirmation requirements is essential to avoid delays or errors.  

### Common Cryptocurrency Confirmation Requirements  
| Cryptocurrency | Required Confirmations |  
|----------------|------------------------|  
| Bitcoin (BTC)  | 2                      |  
| Ethereum (ETH) | 30                     |  
| Litecoin (LTC) | 4                      |  
| USDT (ERC-20)  | 30                     |  
| USDT (TRC-20)  | 20                     |  

**FAQ 1:** *Why do confirmations vary across cryptocurrencies?*  
Confirmations depend on the blockchain's network speed and security protocols. Faster networks like Ethereum (ETH) require more confirmations to ensure transaction finality compared to slower ones like Bitcoin.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Check USDT Transactions  

### 1. **Use a Blockchain Explorer**  
To verify a USDT transaction, utilize a blockchain explorer like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) (for Ethereum-based USDT) or [Tronscan](https://tronscan.org/) (for TRC-20 USDT). Follow these steps:  
1. **Copy the transaction hash (TXID)** from your wallet or exchange.  
2. **Paste it into the explorer's search bar** and press "Enter."  
3. **Review the transaction status**:  
   - **Confirmed**: The transaction is valid and irreversible.  
   - **Pending**: The transaction is still processing (wait for confirmations).  

### 2. **Check the Receiving Address**  
If you donâ€™t have a transaction hash, verify the **receiving address** directly:  
1. **Enter the address** into the explorer.  
2. **Review the transaction history** to locate your transfer.  

### 3. **Monitor Confirmation Count**  
Most exchanges require a minimum of **20â€“30 confirmations** for USDT deposits. Track the count in real-time via the explorer.  

**FAQ 2:** *What if my USDT transaction is stuck?*  
A pending transaction could result from network congestion or low miner fees. Use the explorer to check the transaction status and confirm itâ€™s not dropped.

## How to Track USDT on Different Blockchains  

USDT operates on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Tron, and Omni. Ensure you use the correct explorer for the network your transaction used.  

### Ethereum (ERC-20) USDT  
- **Explorer**: [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Search the transaction hash or wallet address.  
  2. Look for "Token Transfer" events under the "ERC-20 Token Txns" tab.  

### Tron (TRC-20) USDT  
- **Explorer**: [Tronscan](https://tronscan.org/)  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Enter the transaction hash or address.  
  2. Review the "TRC20 Transfer" section for details.  

### Omni (Bitcoin) USDT  
- **Explorer**: [Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/)  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Input the Bitcoin address associated with USDT.  
  2. Check the "USDT" balance and transaction history.  

**FAQ 3:** *Can I recover USDT sent to the wrong blockchain?*  
Sending USDT to an incompatible network may result in permanent loss. Always confirm the network before transferring funds.
