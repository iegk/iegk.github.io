## Frequently Asked Questions  

### What defines a crypto-related stock?  
These are equities of companies involved in blockchain infrastructure, crypto mining, digital payments, or significant BTC/altcoin holdings. Examples include MicroStrategy (BTC holder), Coinbase (exchange operator), and NVIDIA (mining hardware supplier).  

### Are crypto stocks suitable for conservative portfolios?  
While higher-risk than blue-chip stocks, diversified crypto-exposed companies (e.g., payment processors like Block Inc.) offer moderate entry points. Allocate no more than 5-10% of your portfolio to this sector.  

### Which crypto stock offers the strongest growth potential?  
MicroStrategy and Tesla lead for pure BTC exposure. For diversified blockchain play, consider **Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)** or **Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT)** for mining expertise.  

### How does Bitcoin price volatility impact these stocks?  
Direct correlation exists between BTC prices and pure-play stocks (e.g., RIOT). Diversified companies (e.g., Block Inc.) show weaker correlation due to mixed revenue streams.  

### What tools help analyze crypto stocks?  
Use platforms like:  
- **Yahoo Finance** (market data)  
- **Bloomberg** (industry analysis)
