## Anticipation Builds for White House Crypto Summit

Market dynamics are being shaped by speculation surrounding Donald Trump's upcoming crypto summit. Traders anticipate potential announcements regarding a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, creating palpable tension in the market. This event coincides with Wall Street's improved risk appetite driven by expectations that Trump's tariff policies may not persist.

Volatility metrics remain concerning:
| Index | Current Level | Recent High | Historical Context |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| BVIV (Bitcoin Volatility) | 61% | 66% (Tuesday) | Feb Low: 49.6% |
| VIX (Market Fear Gauge) | 23.65 | 23.65 (Dec High) | 30-Day Avg: 21.5 |
| MOVE (Treasury Volatility) | 104 | 104 (Nov High) | 90-Day Avg: 95 |

## Traditional Markets Signal Uncertainty

The U.S. Treasury yield curve inversion - where 10-year notes yield less than 3-month bills - raises recession concerns. According to Noelle Acheson of *Crypto is Macro Now*, this inversion typically precedes economic contractions. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model suggests a potential 3% Q1 contraction, with today's update critical for market sentiment.

**Key Macro Events This Week:**
- March 6: ECB interest rate decision (2.65% expected)
- March 7: U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (160K expected)
- March 8: Chinese CPI/PPI data release
- March 15: Sei (SEI) token unlock ($12.88M)
