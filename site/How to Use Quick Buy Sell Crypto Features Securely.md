# How to Use Quick Buy/Sell Crypto Features Securely

Cryptocurrency trading platforms have revolutionized digital asset transactions through user-friendly interfaces and enhanced security protocols. This comprehensive guide explores the streamlined process of buying and selling crypto through C2C (Customer-to-Customer) trading channels, focusing on optimal practices for both mobile and web platforms.

## Understanding C2C Trading Mechanics

Before initiating transactions, ensure your application is updated to the latest version and complete the mandatory identity verification process. This includes linking your verified bank account under your real name to maintain compliance with financial regulations.

**Key Security Measure:**  
Platforms implement a **T+N safety protection mechanism** that temporarily restricts selling or withdrawing assets for 1-7 days following purchases. This duration varies based on risk assessment algorithms analyzing your transaction patterns. Users preferring immediate liquidity should avoid orders triggering this protection.
