- **BTC** gained 93% against gold  
- **ETH** gained 39% against gold  

This outperformance occurred amid global economic uncertainty, attracting institutional and retail investors seeking alternative value stores.  

| Asset        | 2023 Gain vs. Gold |

| ETH          | 39%                |  
| Gold         | 0% (Benchmark)     |  

### Comparative Volatility  
While BTC and ETH exhibit higher volatility than gold, their price movements have shown greater stability compared to historical trends. Key observations:  
1. **BTC's 2023 maximum drawdown**: -20.1% (vs. -62% in 2019)  
2. **ETH's 2023 maximum drawdown**: -44% (vs. -60%+ historically)

- Current drawdown: -38% (vs. -50%+ in prior bear markets)

## Investor Sentiment Trends  

### Realized Price Analysis  
ETH currently trades at $1,800, 22% above its realized price of $1,475. The realized price represents the average cost basis of all circulating ETH, calculated by the price at which coins last moved.  

| Metric               | Value       |  
|----------------------|-------------|  
| ETH Market Price     | $1,800      |  
| ETH Realized Price   | $1,475      |  
| Profit Margin        | +22%        |  

### MVRV Ratio Insights  
The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio compares current price to realized price. When MVRV exceeds its 180-day moving average, it indicates growing investor profitabilityâ€”a bullish signal.  

Despite early-year gains, ETH's MVRV ratio remains below its long-term average, suggesting lingering bearish momentum from 2022.  

### FAQ: What Does the MVRV Ratio Predict?  
**Q:** How should investors interpret the current MVRV ratio?  
**A:** A ratio below the 180-day MA indicates market caution. Historically, sustained breaches above this level precede major bull runs.

## Confidence Indicators  

### Investor Confidence in Trend  
This metric evaluates ETH investor sentiment by comparing seller and holder cost bases:  
- **Red Zone**: Sellers' cost basis < holders' = bearish  
- **Green Zone**: Sellers' cost basis > holders' = bullish  
- **Orange Zone**: Transitional phase  

Current data places ETH in a transitional phaseâ€”slightly positive but lacking strong conviction.

## Altseason Dynamics  

### Dollar vs. BTC Performance  
Our updated Altseason indicator combines two conditions:  
1. Capital inflows into BTC, ETH, and stablecoins  
2. Positive momentum in altcoin total market cap (excluding BTC/ETH/stablecoins)  

Key findings:  
- Altcoin market cap grew +21.3% in six trading days (Oct 2023)  
- BTC's market cap surged 110% YoY vs. altcoins' 37% growth  

### Bitcoin Dominance Surge  
BTC's dominance reached 53% (up from 38% in 2022), highlighting its status as the preferred crypto investment amid regulatory scrutiny on altcoins.  

| Metric                  | BTC       | Altcoins  |  
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|  
| YoY Market Cap Growth   | 110%      | 37%       |  
| Dominance %             | 53%       | 47%       |  

### FAQ: Why Are Altcoins Underperforming BTC?  
**Q:** If altcoins gained 37%, why call it underperformance?  
**A:** BTC's 110% growth created a "capital waterfall" effectâ€”BTC rallies drive altcoin inflows, but BTC itself captures disproportionate market share.
