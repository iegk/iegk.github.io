## Understanding Common Scam Tactics

Modern scammers combine psychological manipulation with technical exploits to steal digital assets. Recognizing these prevalent schemes empowers proactive defense:

- **Phishing attacks**: Malicious links masquerade as authentic platforms to harvest wallet credentials
- **Compromised apps**: Security vulnerabilities in wallets/exchanges enable unauthorized access
- **Blackmail scams**: Threats of exposing sensitive information in exchange for crypto ransoms
- **MLM schemes**: Decentralized pyramid structures collapse when recruitment slows

### 2. Strategic Persistence Pays Off

Recovery often requires sustained effort across multiple fronts:

| Action Item          | Recommended Frequency |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|

- **Insurance claims**: Limited coverage exists for exchange breaches (availability varies)
- **Tax deductions**: Documented losses may qualify as capital/property theft for tax relief
- **Chargeback mechanisms**: Attempt card transaction reversals through issuing banks

### 5. Long-Term Security Reinforcement

Prevent future incidents through:

- Device encryption and multi-layered authentication
- Regular security audits of connected platforms
- Ongoing education about emerging scam patterns
