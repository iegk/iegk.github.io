# Bitwise Debuts Momentum-Based ‚ÄúTrendwise‚Äù Strategies  

## Introduction to Trendwise Strategies  
Crypto specialist Bitwise Asset Management has transformed three of its crypto futures ETFs by adopting momentum-driven strategies designed to rotate exposure between cryptocurrencies and U.S. Treasuries. This innovative approach, named **Trendwise**, aims to enhance **risk-adjusted returns** for investors by leveraging price trends in Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.  

The shift from long-only strategies to dynamic rotation reflects Bitwise‚Äôs commitment to addressing investor demand for smarter crypto exposure. By integrating proprietary signals based on exponential moving averages (EMAs), the Trendwise framework seeks to mitigate downside risks while capturing upside potential.  

## Key Funds Transitioning to Trendwise  
Investors can access the Trendwise strategy through Bitwise‚Äôs existing ETFs, now rebranded to reflect their new mandate:  

- **BITC**: The Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF  
- **AETH**: The Bitwise Trendwise Ethereum and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF  
- **BTOP**: The Bitwise Trendwise BTC/ETH and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF  

These funds will dynamically allocate assets between crypto futures and U.S. Treasuries based on market momentum, offering diversified options for investors targeting Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a combination of both.  

## How the Trendwise Strategy Works  
The core mechanism behind Trendwise relies on analyzing the **10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages (EMAs)** of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The strategy operates on a simple principle:  

- **Crypto Exposure**: When the 10-day EMA crosses above the 20-day EMA, the fund allocates 100% to crypto futures.  
- **Treasuries Exposure**: When the 10-day EMA falls below the 20-day EMA, the fund shifts entirely to U.S. Treasury securities.  

This rules-based approach eliminates emotional decision-making, ensuring disciplined entry and exit points. By rotating assets based on momentum, Trendwise aims to reduce volatility and protect capital during downturns.  

> ‚ÄúInvestors tell us they want smart exposure to crypto‚Äôs potential,‚Äù said Matt Hougan, Bitwise‚Äôs Chief Investment Officer. ‚ÄúThese new Trendwise strategies capitalize on momentum‚Äîa widely understood market dynamic‚Äîto boost risk-adjusted returns while reducing downside risk.‚Äù  

### Strategic Advantages of Trendwise  
- **Downside Risk Management**: Automatic rotation into Treasuries during bearish trends.  
- **Momentum Capture**: Full exposure to crypto gains during bullish phases.  
- **Cost Efficiency**: No changes to expense ratios or tax treatments (see expense ratio table below).  

| Fund  | Net Expense Ratio | Gross Expense Ratio |  
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|  
| BITC  | 0.88%             | 3.39%               |  
| AETH  | 0.90%             | 1.57%               |  
| BTOP  | 0.90%             | 1.36%               |  

## Market Context and Investor Demand  
The launch of Trendwise aligns with growing institutional interest in **crypto ETFs** that balance innovation with risk management. According to Teddy Fusaro, Bitwise‚Äôs President, ‚ÄúInvestors increasingly seek tailored access to crypto markets. Trendwise strategies provide a groundbreaking solution for those who want exposure without compromising on risk control.‚Äù

## Risks and Considerations  
While Trendwise aims to optimize returns, investors must weigh the following risks:  

### General Risks for All Trendwise Funds  
- **Market Volatility**: Crypto markets are inherently volatile, with prices influenced by regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends, and technological developments.  
- **Liquidity Risks**: Futures markets may experience illiquidity, impacting trade execution.  
- **Contango Effects**: Extended contango in futures markets could underperform spot prices.  
- **Leverage Risks**: Futures contracts inherently use leverage, amplifying both gains and losses.  

### Fund-Specific Risks  
#### AETH (Ethereum Futures ETF)  
- **Ethereum Network Risks**: Ethereum‚Äôs evolving ecosystem and regulatory uncertainty could affect performance.  
- **Roll Costs**: Frequent contract rollovers may increase transaction costs.  

#### BITC (Bitcoin Futures ETF)  
- **Bitcoin Adoption Risks**: Slower-than-expected institutional adoption could depress prices.  
- **Blockchain Vulnerabilities**: Potential security risks in decentralized networks.  

#### BTOP (BTC/ETH Combined ETF)  
- **Concentration Risks**: Nondiversified holdings increase exposure to individual asset volatility.  
- **Dual Market Exposure**: Combined BTC/ETH exposure magnifies sector-specific risks.
