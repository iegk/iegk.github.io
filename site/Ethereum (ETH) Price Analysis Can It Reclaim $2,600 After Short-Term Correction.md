# Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Can It Reclaim $2,600 After Short-Term Correction?

## Ethereum Maintains Structural Bullish Recovery

After reaching a local high of $2,623 earlier this week, Ethereum (ETH) price has retreated to $2,445. This correction revealed crucial support levels at $2,420-$2,430, which align with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on weekly charts. The cryptocurrency's ability to hold above these levels confirms its ongoing bullish structure since March's low of $1,385.

### Technical Indicators Signal Short-Term Consolidation

The weekly chart shows Ethereum maintaining positions above both 23.6% and 38.2% Fibonacci levels, suggesting structural strength. However, breaking $2,745 resistance remains critical for confirming broader trend reversals. Current market dynamics reveal:

- **RSI at 43.2**: Neutral momentum in 4-hour timeframe
- **MACD Divergence**: Bearish crossover fading in 30-minute charts
- **Bollinger Bands**: Converging patterns indicate decreasing volatility

## Short-Term Bullish Flag Pattern Emerges

4-hour charts reveal a developing bullish flag pattern following Ethereum's $2,100 to $2,600 rally. Price action currently tests the flag's lower boundary, where convergence with EMA20 and Bollinger Bands creates a critical support cluster at $2,420-$2,430.

### Key Support/Resistance Levels
| Level Type | Price Points |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Resistance** | $2,555 / $2,600 / $2,745 |
| **Support** | $2,420 / $2,300 / $2,246 |

This technical formation suggests potential for renewed upside momentum if buyers defend the $2,420 psychological level. A breakout could target $2,555 initially before retesting $2,600 resistance.

### Why Ethereum Price Dropped Today

The current correction stems from:
1. **Profit-taking**: After parabolic gains between May 8-11
2. **Technical Resistance**: $2,555-$2,600 zone remains formidable
3. **Momentum Indicators**: RSI needs to reclaim 50 threshold for sustained bullish momentum

## Market Structure Analysis

Daily charts show Ethereum has successfully broken above the critical $1,940 trendline resistance. However, Bollinger Bands contraction in 4-hour frames warns of potential volatility compression before the next major move.

### Ethereum Price Forecast Table
| Metric | Value/Signal |
|--------|--------------|
| **Current ETH Price** | $2,445 |
| **Key Resistance Levels** | $2,555 / $2,600 / $2,745 |
| **Critical Support Zones** | $2,420 / $2,300 / $2,246 |
| **RSI (4H)** | 43.2 (Neutral) |
| **MACD (30M)** | Bearish crossover fading |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Bullish flag formation |
| **Short-Term Bias** | Sideways-to-Bullish |
| **Volatility Outlook** | Decreasing short-term |

## Short-Term Outlook: Testing $2,600 Again?

The path of least resistance depends on:
- **Volume Confirmation**: Breakout needs significant volume above $2,460
- **Momentum Shifts**: RSI crossing 50 would validate bullish resumption
- **Pattern Completion**: Flag breakout typically equals pattern height

Failure to hold $2,420 could accelerate corrections toward $2,300 or EMA50 at $2,246. More aggressive selling might test EMA100 at $2,071, but this scenario remains less likely while weekly bullish structure intact.
